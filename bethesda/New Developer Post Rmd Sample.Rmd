Writing my plain text here.

`r ### You will be using the preapproval tag in your developer hub`
`r #Your pre-approval tag`

`r # make sure to name chunks, as I did here "somechunk"`
`r # echo = FALSE will be standard to avoid outputting code to the document`
`r # echo = TRUE can be useful for debugging`

```{r somechunk, echo = FALSE}

# The first form input is form_fields[1], the second is form_fields[2], etc.

# Text input gives the string as input (alphanumeric and hyphens only)
sym <- 'SPY'# form_fields[1]

# Radio input returns the literal string value of the radio button selected
print(form_fields[2])

# Supress package startup for clearer documents
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(data.table))

# ignore this, I have stored some functions server side
# if you would like to fetch stock data, go ahead and pass 
# stock symbols to this function
source("functions/yahoo.R")
Y <- yahoo(sym)
if(is.null(hist)) stop("Stock symbol not found.")

print(
plot(Y[["Open"]], main = paste0(sym, " Historical Closing Price"), type='l',
 xlab = "", ylab = "")
)

# "upload" inputs return a file path to form_fields[n]
read.csv(form_fields[3])

ASDF <- read.table(form_fields[4])


```
